    <h3>CMakeEasy</h3>
    <img src="assets/cmakeeasy.png"/>
    <p>This project is a terminal-based CMakeLists.txt generator. It was designed with the
        idea of creating these types of files in a much shorter timeframe than physically
        typing out the full context of a CMakeLists file.</p>
    <p>CMakeEasy loosely follows the organizational pattern of a typical CMakeLists file,
        starting with CMake version requirements and ending with post-compilation commands.
    </p>
    <p>The documentation for this project is formatted as an HTML page, which means it should
        be easily readable by most web browsers.</p>
